# Townchest

A minetest mod contains a chest with building definitions. The chest can spawn a NPC that does build the building for you.

## Features

- WorldEdit file target
  - A Chest that allows you to choose a building and manage the building options
  - The most WorldEdit files are supported. just put the file to the buildings directory
  - Flatting and cleanup the building place, remove all cruft-nodes from building inside
  - Cleanup unknown nodes
  - Ground level detection trough dirt_with_* nodes
  - Optimized for realy big buildings. Try the AMMOnym_coloseum.we as a showcase

- Creative build
  - Instant build allow you to get the building instantly
  - Creative build by NPC without providing needed nodes

- Builder-NPC's
  - Multiple NPC's per building can be used (to get Clolseum in time you need ~50 NPC's oO)
  - NPC can change the assigned building if chest is stopped and an other active chest nearly

## Roadmap (not implemented yet)
- Survival mode
  - each NPC gets own inventory
  - build a node only if there is place in inventory for the old one and the new one is avialable in inventory
  - Use all nearly default:chest to store removed nodes (flatting) and to get nodes for building

- Node mapping support
  - a way to change the needed nodes (like in building defined default:wood but I like to use something from moretrees mod)
  - the mapping should be able to map the unknown nodes

- Support mts files

## Vision / Ideas / maybe
- other chests that generates a plan. The generated plan can be the daily work of a lumberjack as example
